The main web application is running on port 5000, and the command-line GeniusEdu management system is also running and waiting for a login. Looking at your project, it appears you have two versions of your educational system: 1. A command-line interface version (genius_edu.py) 2. A web-based version (main.py with Flask) Let's examine the submit_assignment function that was causing errors:

Create a Replit project called school_ai that exposes a single /api POST endpoint and, using only your OPENAI_API_KEY, delivers nine JSON-based services—including quiz generation, flash-card creation, student-work analysis, teacher dashboards, lesson summaries, personalised learning paths, webcam-driven study-buddy advice, LMS auto-tools, and engagement heat-maps—driven by one master prompt (MASTER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE) defining strict input/output schemas.
Return every response as {success, feature, data} without extra text, handle validation errors gracefully, and keep the project lean with Python 3.12, Flask, openai, and python-dotenv as the only backend dependencies plus browser-side TensorFlow.js and Chart.js for the optional webcam and dashboard demos.
